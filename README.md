## Case Study
**MaxAB** is a growing **FMCG** manufacturer in **Alx, Egypt**.
It operates in three cities (Alex, Suez, Damietta) and plans to expand to Tier 1 cities within two years.
However, some key customers have not renewed their contracts due to service issues, likely caused by late or incomplete deliveries.
Management wants to solve this problem before expanding and has asked to track service levels for all customers.

## Process
1) Explore, understand and validating all data.
2) Importing and clean data and Adding some columns to aid in data analysis, such as a column to identify the day type weekend or weekday with power query. 
3) Data modeling
4) Creating Measures using DAX
5) Creating the Dashboard
